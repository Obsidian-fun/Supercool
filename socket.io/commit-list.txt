Pain points:
1. Text does not automatically scroll to bottom when it reaches end of text box. [Resolved]
2. Last message requires padding-bottom otherwise it cannot be seen. [Resolved]
3. For every new instance created, the socket creates an extra socket- on the second window, node creates 2 sockets, on the third window node creates 3 sockets. [Resolved, remove it from the get request]
4. Stop Double, triple, etc. login for the same account.
