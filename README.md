# SUPER COOL CHAT

## A simple chat application where users can create accounts and interact either in a public chat space or if privacy is needed, a specific room can be setup for more private conversations.

## This project is based on the socket.io library, and uses the power of websockets to create the private rooms.

## Authentication is from this project https://github.com/Obsidian-fun/authentication and utilizes bcrypt hashes to save passwords which is stored in a MySQL database.
